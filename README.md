**Private trackers sometimes forget to spoiler your sensitive keys like your API/RSS/IRC and that's lame**

As you can see above, I’ve inspect element'd my IRC key, RSS key, and Torrent passkey. If I didn’t, they’d be exposed in plain text right now. That’s no bueno. The whole reason I made this userscript is because we all screenshot our private tracker info from time to time; whether it’s to keep a record of your account or use it as proof for joining another tracker. It’s a pretty normal thing, but not every private tracker hides your sensitive info by default. And if you’re on as many [private](https://i.imgur.com/Vztcyvt.png) [trackers](https://i.imgur.com/J75bnF4.png) as I am, the screenshot process can get a little out of hand, and you might forget to hide or change your key (I’ve done it too). And that’s when things go wrong. So yeah, here we are. You’re welcome.

The above image is now showing a very cute, spoilered image. Good luck getting my secret codes now, random people of the internet who look at screenshots I forgot to spoiler keys on!
